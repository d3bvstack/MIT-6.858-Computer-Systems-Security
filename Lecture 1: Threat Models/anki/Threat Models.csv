"Front","Back"
"What is the definition of security?","Security = achieving some goal even when an adversary is trying to stop you."
"What are the three main ingredients for reasoning about security?","Policy, Threat Model, Mechanism"
"What is a 'policy' in security?","A statement of the desired behavior of a system with respect to security: who can read, modify, or access data (confidentiality, integrity, availability)."
"What is 'confidentiality'?","Who is allowed to read a piece of data."
"What is 'integrity'?","Who is allowed to modify data or take actions."
"What is 'availability'?","Who should be able to use the system and when; resisting DoS attacks."
"What questions should a good policy answer?","What to protect, who may read/modify, and availability expectations."
"What is a 'threat model'?","Assumptions about the attacker: who they are, their goals, and their capabilities."
"Why are threat models necessary?","Defending against an all-powerful attacker is impossible; threat models let us define realistic attacker capabilities."
"What is a 'mechanism' in security?","The actual technology that enforces a policy (OS protections, cryptography, application logic, etc.)."
"Why is security considered a 'negative goal'?","Because it requires proving that no unauthorized actor can violate the policy — you must account for every possible attack path."
"How should you pick threat model assumptions?","Be conservative: assume attackers can do more rather than less, and be realistic about human and environmental factors."
"How do account recovery questions change the authentication policy?","They add an alternate authentication path that can often be guessed or found publicly, weakening security."
"What is the Mat Honan case in one sentence?","An attacker chained recovery flows across Amazon, Apple, and Gmail to take over Mat Honan's accounts by using partial information and other services' policies."
"What lesson does the Mat Honan attack teach?","Security boundaries span multiple services; trusting other sites' policies/UI can create unintended attack chains."
"Name two common human-factor threat model mistakes." ,"Assuming users pick strong unique passwords and won't click phishing links."
"Why must cryptographic assumptions be reviewed over time?","Hardware and attacks improve; algorithms or key sizes safe today (e.g., 56-bit DES) may be insecure later."
"Why is relying on the web PKI (CAs) risky?","Browsers trust many CAs; any single compromised or malicious CA can issue certificates for any domain, making the weakest CA a global weak link."
"What does the DARPA Secure OS story illustrate?","The build and supply chain are part of the threat model; insecure development infrastructure can backdoor a secure system."
"What was the iCloud password guessing mechanism bug?","Some iCloud interfaces didn't enforce rate-limiting (e.g., 'Find my iPhone' API), allowing offline brute-force attempts."
"What is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) bug (Citibank example)?","A server trusted a client parameter like 'id' without verifying it belonged to the logged-in user, exposing other customers' data."
"What Android SecureRandom bug caused Bitcoin theft?","PRNGs were sometimes seeded predictably (or poorly), producing predictable signatures/nonces and enabling private key recovery."
"How can null bytes in SSL certificate hostnames be abused?","A length-prefixed name like 'amazon.com\0x.foo.com' can be treated as 'amazon.com' by null-terminated parsers, letting attackers get certs that browsers accept for other domains."
"What is a buffer overflow?","A bug that writes beyond an allocated buffer's bounds, possibly overwriting control data like saved return addresses."
"Why is gets() dangerous in C?","It reads input without length checks and can overflow fixed-size buffers."
"What are two major exploitation techniques for buffer overflows?","Code injection (place shellcode in buffer) and return-to-code/ROP to reuse existing code."
"Name three common mitigations against buffer overflow attacks.","Stack canaries, non-executable stack/heap (NX), and ASLR (address space layout randomization)."
"Why don't these mitigations eliminate all buffer overflow risks?","They raise the cost and complexity of exploitation but do not fix the root cause (unsafe memory operations)."
"Give the core checklist for secure system design.","Policy (what to protect), Threat model (who/abilities), Mechanism (where enforced), check for weakest links and interactions with other systems."
"What is the triad mantra recommended to analyze systems?","Policy, Threat Model, Mechanism"
"How do you avoid relying on others' UIs or partial secret displays (like last-4 digits)?","Treat any displayed or partial data as potentially public and avoid designing policies that depend on them being secret."
"What does 'minimize the trusted computing base (TCB)' mean?","Reduce the number of components that must be treated as secure so a failure has smaller impact."
